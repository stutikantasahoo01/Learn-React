# Axios:-

# While modern browsers have a built-in way to do this called the fetch API, developers often prefer Axios because it simplifies common tasks and handles a lot of the "boilerplate" code for you.

# Axios is Promise-based, meaning it uses JavaScript Promises to handle asynchronous operations. This allows you to use the clean async/await syntax we discussed earlier to manage data fetching.

# axios.get method:-

# The axios.get() method is the most common way to retrieve data from a server. In technical terms, it performs an HTTP GET request, which is used to "read" or "fetch" information without changing anything on the server.

# (1)=> GET => axios.get() => Read => Retrieve data from the server.
# (2)=> POST => axios.post() => Create => Send new data to the server to create a resource.
# (3)=> PUT => axios.put() => Update => Replace an existing resource entirely.
# (4)=> DELETE => axios.delete() => Delete => Remove a resource from the server.
